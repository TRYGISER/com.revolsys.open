/**
 * This implementation is a port of Shewchuks original implementation in c
 * which is placed in the public domain:
 *
 * [...]
 *  Placed in the public domain by
 *  Jonathan Richard Shewchuk
 *  School of Computer Science
 *  Carnegie Mellon University
 *  5000 Forbes Avenue
 *  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  15213-3891
 *  jrs@cs.cmu.edu
 *  [...]
 *
 *  See http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html for information about the original implementation
 *
 * The strategy used during porting has been to resemble the original as much as possible in order to
 * be able to proofread the result. This strategy has not been followed in the following cases:
 *
 * - function "exactinit" has been replaced by a static block, in order to ensure that the code is only
 *   executed once.
 *
 * - The main part of the so called "tail" functions has been removed in favor to "head" functions. This means
 *   that all calls to such a main functions has been replaced with on call to the head function and one call
 *   to the tail function. The rationale for this is that the corresponding source macros has multiple output parameters
 *   which is not supported in Java. Using objects to pass the results to the caller was not considered for performance
 *   reasons. It is assumed that the extra allocations of memory would affect performance negatively.
 *
 * - The porting of the two_two_diff methods and the other methods involved was tricky since the original macros
 *   had lots of output parameters. These methods has the highest probability of bugs as a result of the porting
 *   operation. Each original function(macro) has been replaced with one method for each output parameter. They are
 *   named as *__x0, *__x2 etc. where the postfix is named after the original output parameter in the SOURCE CODE.
 *   The rational for the naming has been to facilitate proofreading. Each of these methods has an annotation above
 *   it that shows the original macro.
 *
 * - One bug has been found in the original source. The use of the prefix incrementation operator in
 *   fast_expansion_sum_zeroelim caused the code to access memory outside of the array boundary. This is not
 *   allowed in Java which is the reason why this bug was discovered. It is unclear if the code worked correctly
 *   as a compiled c-program. It has been confirmed by valgrind that this actually happens in the original code.
 *   The author of the original code has been contacted, and we are waiting for an answer. All occurences of the
 *   prefix incrementation operator in that function have been replaced with the postfix version. This change looks
 *   reasonable by a quick look at the code, but this needs to be more thoroughly analyzed.
 *
 * - Function orientationIndex is new and its contract is copied from
 *   com.revolsys.geometry.testold.algorithm.CGAlgorithms.orientationIndex so that the current implementation of that method
 *   can be easily replaced.
 *
 * Some relevant comments in the original code has been kept untouched in its entirety. For more in-depth information
 * refer to the original source.

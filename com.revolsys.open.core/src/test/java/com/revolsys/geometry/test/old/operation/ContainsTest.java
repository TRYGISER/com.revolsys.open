   * From GEOS #572.
   * A case where B is contained in A, but

   *
   * The cause is that the long segment in A nodes the single-segment line in B.
   * The node location cannot be computed precisely.
   * The node then tests as not lying precisely on the original long segment in A.
   *
   * The solution is to change the relate algorithm so that it never computes
   * new intersection points, only ones which occur at existing vertices.
   * (The topology of the implicit intersections can still be computed
   * to contribute to the intersection matrix result).
   * This will require a complete reworking of the relate algorithm.
